# CSS transformations
CSS3 has tranfor properties that allow 2D and 3D manipulation of elements.

I have read the materials, but have chosen not to list all of the details here. The reference is readily available on the web, and I believe that trying to commit all the feature to memory unfruitful.
Additionally, I simply ran out of time to write notes as I was reading.
It is a very cool feature that I am excited to try out. I love thinking spatially and transform will allow me to do that.
