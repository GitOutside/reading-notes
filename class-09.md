CSS allows you to manipulate the elements in HTML 
You can take objects out of the normal flow and place them in a location to make the flow of the page work better. 
CSS treats all elements as if they were in a box. It will position them realtive to various components of the page.
**relative** this moves an element realtive to where it would be in normal flow
**absolute** moves an element in relation to containing element
**fixed** is in relation to the browser window
**floating** takes an element out of normal flow and puts it as far left or right
 - clearing a float means that nothing can touch the chosen side. This helps when elements block others from proper alignment
 **z-index** allows you to control elements in the z axis

 You can create multi-column pages with float. 

 Due to the variation in screen sizes, your design needs to work in  a wide range of sizes. Resolution is the problem here. Resolution is the number of dots per inch a screen renders. **The hgher the resolution, the smaller the text appears.**

 standard page size is 960-1000 px wide. Most users can see designs on all screens

 ### Fixed width vs liquid layouts
 - **fixed** designs do not change size. measurements given in pixels

 -**liquid** designs stretch and contract as user changes screeen. Tend to use %

 Designers use wireframes and layout grids to organize elements of a page

 YOu can use CSS to create grid layouts, styling forms, and other things. Has code bloat because often includes more code than you need for a project.
