You can create tables with HTMl with  ```<table>``` 
Table rows ```<tr>```
table cells```<td>`` whiich stands for table data
headings for colums and rows ```<th>```

You can span cells with ***rowspan*** and ***colspan***

If you have a long table that is longer than the screen, keep the header and footers in place while data scrolls with ```<thead> <tbody> <tfoot>```
