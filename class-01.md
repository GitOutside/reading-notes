# HTML
HTML uses tags that names different elements of a page, such as paragraphs ```<p>```, headings ```<h1>```, or images ```<img>```.
The tags give the page structure by dividing up the congtent into containers. 
Tags are paired up, with an opening and closing tag. The closing tag has a forward slash within, like ```</h1>```.
Attributes can be inseted inside tags to add more info about the element.
The three main elements of a basic web page are ```<head>```, ```<body>```, and ```<title>```. Everything that can be seen on a webpage is inside the body element. The head has meta-data, and the title is what is displayed on the page tab.

HTML5 is the newest version. Use ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` to inidicate which language you're using. Comments can beadded for other people to read, not the computer, using ```<!-->```. Class attribute can be used to group several elements. Id attributes are unitque to only one element.
Some elements are inline and some are block. Block elements start on a new line, inine elements are like they sound.
The ```<div>``` element is too general and not used much on HTML5. Use more descriptive tags.

When designing webpages, consider who the site is for, why they go tho the site, and what they want to achieve. Design the page with wireframes to give a high level view of what the page will look like, then use HTML to break it up.

Use grouping, visual hierarchy, and inages to design for easy useage.

# JavaScript
Uses a script to tell the computer what to do. 
1. Define the goal 
2. List the tasks needed to get to goal
3. Code the steps

Computers see eveything as an object. People interact with the objects and events occur. Methods are how the events happen.

JavaScript is the code to make the interactions possible.

Put the script in the page where you want it to happen in the page.
